# Django Social Blog

**My First Django Project!** ðŸŽ‰  

A **social media-style blog** built with Django where users can create posts, like/unlike posts, comment, and interact with other users. This project helped me learn **Django, Bootstrap, authentication, CRUD operations, and relational database handling**.
